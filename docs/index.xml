      <description>About Us Are you a Junior Developer or newbie in the Tech industry? Do you sometimes feel anxious about work or question your own abilities? Are you excited to be starting your career and want to celebrate your accomplishments with others? You are not alone!
With this Meetup group we hope to create a home for all things JuniorDev.
We will be hosting a bi-monthly get-together known as the JuniorDev Social.</description>

      <description>Our target audience are junior devs (but not exclusively just junior devs). Devs of all levels have something to share and learn.
We hope this can help junior devs in Singapore level up, become better at the craft of software engineering. And eventually become effective tech leads.</description>
